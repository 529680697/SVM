# SVM

Simple implementation of SVM.

The data_deal.py file is used for collecting information from the Internetand and first-deal it.
The main.c file will study from the data we collected so that it can classify the new data or predict the result based on new data.

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens.
